# Conway's game of life in Python and in Cython

`py_cellular.py` and `py_opt_cellular.py` are in pure Python and can be run with only `pygame` installed

To run `cy_py_cellular.py` or `cy_py_opt_cellular.py` - cython-accelerated versions - you need to install
everything listed in  `requirements.txt` and then run `setup.bat` to
compile cython source and install resulting c-extension
